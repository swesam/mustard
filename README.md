# 🟡 Mustard or Mother?

**Say "Mustard on a beat" fast. Now say "Mother on a beach." Notice anything?**

A silly single-page website paying homage to [baconbeercan.com](https://www.baconbeercan.com/), but for DJ Mustard fans.

## The Joke

DJ Mustard's iconic producer tag *"Mustard on the beat!"* sounds exactly like *"Mother on a beach!"* when said quickly. Try it. We'll wait.

## Live Site

🔗 **[Coming soon]**
